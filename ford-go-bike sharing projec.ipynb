The core objective revolves around analyzing data from the Ford GoBike System, a prominent service operating within the San Francisco Bay Area. This project underscores the pivotal role of data visualization as an essential skill in the broader realm of data analysis. It emphasizes its utility not only in exploratory data analysis but also in refining data through wrangling and effectively communicating findings.\n","\n","The project systematically navigates through various stages, from initial data investigation and wrangling to in-depth univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. By dissecting the Ford GoBike dataset, which encompasses details of individual rides, the project delves into understanding usage patterns and influential factors.
